Fruitware gulp
==============

Fruitware gulp starting file

## Getting started

1. copy the files from the repo into *markup* folder in your project.
1. run `npm install` in markup folder
2. run `gulp structure` to get all starting files in place
3. run `gulp generate` to create the build folder and generate all css, js and image files into it.
4. run `gulp` to watch for changes.

Every time you stop gulp and continue working later on, just run `gulp`.

## Localhost and Livereload

After running gulp, you can access your site at [localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

Live reload is already running on this port, but you need to enable it with browser extension.

You can download [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) or [firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/livereload/), and enable it on the working page by clicking the extension icon in toolbar.
